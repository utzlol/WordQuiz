<h1>How to Use this program</h1><br>
Use option <b>-a</b> to add a word or many words to the dictionary AKA word.txt.<br>
And then you just type <b>y</b> or enter it with <b>blank character</b> and fill the option to add a word.<br>
If you wanna save it, just type <b>s</b> or <b>n</b> and It's automatically exit too.<br><br><br>
Use option <b>-d</b> to delete specific word from dictionary.<br>
Type <b>exit</b> to exit from the program. But, even though you didn't type It, the word that you enter has been deleted instantly when you enter which one word that you want to delete. So becareful! I'll add more improvement as fast as possible.
